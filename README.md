# Image Recognition with .NET Core (Workshop)

Welcome to the world where machine image understanding is just a REST call away!

You will build a REST API for two retail scenarios:

* Customer walks into a store and is recognized by their face. Shopping assistant immediately gets a notification that particular Mr./Mrs. X is here and there's a special offer just for them.
* Customer walks out of the store. Instead of presenting them with physical buttons, we let them rate their experience by performing an internationally understandable gesture: Thumbs UP / Thumbs DOWN.

Even though there's a front-end part present in these exercises, we will focus mostly on backend and build an universally deployable API which can be used from a website or mobile app.

Technically, we'll use **ASP.NET Core** and **Microsoft Cognitive Services**, specifically Face API and Custom Vision API.
